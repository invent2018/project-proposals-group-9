## Audience
We aim to create a software that assists users of e-commerce platforms who are trying to sell their products online but lack the pricing information and knowledge of market demand.

## Problems
As an individual seller, new users lack the knowledge on how to price their products to attract buyers, and market research is a time consuming process.
For some they may be unaware of whether there is demand for their product.

Currently, there are no existing solutions we know of. However, there is reason to believe that online shopping platforms (e.g. Amazon, eBay) are working on a similar software to improve their platform.

## Solution
A machine learning algorithm that suggests a selling price for a certain good based on variables such as
* Average price of identical/similar goods
* Product Seasonality
* Elasticity to competitor prices
* Whether it has been used before/condition of product
The algorithm also uses sentiment analysis to collect data from social media as an indicator for demand


## Assumptions
New sellers are unsure as to how to price their goods effectively
New sellers lack information about the demand for the good they are trying to sell

## Unique Selling Point
This product will save a lot of time spent on market research
It will also encourage more users to enter the market and use the platform
Reduces waste by promoting a convenient method for online sales
Will allow people to know whether there is demand for their good by using social media data

## Competitors
Currently, there are no existing solutions we know of. However, there is reason to believe that online shopping platforms (e.g. Amazon, eBay) are working on a similar software to improve their platform.
